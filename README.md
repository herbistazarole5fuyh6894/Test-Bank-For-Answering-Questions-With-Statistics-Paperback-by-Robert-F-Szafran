  * Finally, an introductory statistics text that provides broad coverage, limited theory, clear explanations, plenty of practice opportunities, and examples that engage today′s students! Using General Social Survey data from 1980 and 2010, Robert Szafran asks students to consider how young adults have changed over the last 30 years. Students learn to select an appropriate data analysis technique, carry out the analysis, and draw appropriate conclusions. Changes in subjective beliefs (such as freedom of speech and abortion) and objective characteristics (like years of schooling and marital status) are examined. In answering the question about how young adults have changed, students acquire a broad knowledge of basic statistics and extensive experience with SPSS.
